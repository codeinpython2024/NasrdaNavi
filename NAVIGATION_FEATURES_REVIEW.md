**Test Case:**
- Searched for "Centre for Atmospheric Research"
- Autocomplete showed results as typing progressed
- Result displayed: "Centre for Atmospheric Research - building - Research Division"
- Map zoomed to building location upon selection

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/search?q={query}` - Returns up to 10 matching results
- Searches across building names, departments, and room names
- Case-insensitive matching

**Observations:**

### 3. **Route Generation & Turn-by-Turn Directions** ✅ WORKING

**Functionality:**
- Generates optimal routes between start and destination points
- Displays blue route line on map
- Provides detailed turn-by-turn directions with:
  - Cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, etc.)
  - Turn types (turn left/right, slight left/right, continue, U-turn)
  - Distance to next turn in meters
  - Named roads for each segment
  - Total distance and estimated time

**Test Routes:**

#### Route 1: Short Route (262m)
- **Distance:** 262m
- **Time:** 3m 7s
- **Steps:** 5 instructions
- **Directions:**
  1. Head northwest on Southwest Lane 10
  2. In 41 m, turn right onto Northwest Path 16
  3. In 49 m, turn left onto Northwest Lane 2
  4. In 102 m, turn left onto Northwest Path 17
  5. Continue for 68 m to arrive at your destination

#### Route 2: Longer Route (478m)
- **Distance:** 478m
- **Time:** 5m 42s
- **Steps:** 4 instructions
- **Directions:**
  1. Head west on Northwest Path 17
  2. In 68 m, turn right onto Northwest Lane 2
  3. In 341 m, turn right onto Southeast Lane 1
  4. Continue for 68 m to arrive at your destination

#### Route 3: Complex Route (544m)
- **Distance:** 544m
- **Time:** 6m 28s
- **Steps:** 8 instructions
- **Directions:**
  1. Head west on Northwest Path 17
  2. In 68 m, turn right onto Northwest Lane 2
  3. In 341 m, continue onto Southeast Lane 1
  4. In 28 m, continue onto Southeast Lane 4
  5. In 15 m, slight left onto Museum Road
  6. In 14 m, slight left to stay on Museum Road
  7. In 67 m, turn left to stay on Museum Road
  8. Continue for 8 m to arrive at your destination

**Routing Algorithm:**
- Uses NetworkX shortest path algorithm with Dijkstra's method
- Weights based on Haversine distance calculation
- Supports one-way roads (forward, backward, bidirectional)
- Snaps user clicks to nearest road node (max 50m threshold)

**Direction Generation:**
- Calculates compass bearings between path segments
- Determines turn angles and classifies turns:
  - < 45°: continue straight
  - 45-80°: slight turn
  - 80-135°: regular turn
  - 135-170°: sharp turn
  - > 170°: U-turn
- Tracks road name changes
- Provides distance-aware instructions

**Observations:**
- Accurate distance calculations using Haversine formula
- Clear, natural language directions
- Walking speed estimate: 1.4 m/s (reasonable)
- Instructions include both turn types and road names
- Handles complex routes with multiple turns effectively

---

### 4. **Accessible Routes Only** ✅ FUNCTIONAL

**Functionality:**
- Checkbox option to filter for accessible routes
- When checked, routing API receives `accessible=true` parameter
- Backend can filter routes based on accessibility attributes

**Test Case:**
- Enabled "Accessible routes only" checkbox
- Generated route with accessible mode active
- API call: `/route?start=...&end=...&accessible=true`

**Current Behavior:**
- Checkbox toggles successfully
- Parameter passed to backend correctly
- Route remains the same (indicates current route is already accessible)

**Observations:**
- Feature is implemented and functional
- Effectiveness depends on road data having accessibility attributes
- No visual indication of which roads are accessible vs. non-accessible on the map

---

### 5. **Clear Route** ✅ WORKING

**Functionality:**
- Red "Clear Route" button removes current route
- Clears route line from map
- Removes directions panel
- Resets to initial navigation state
- Keeps start point if one was set

**Observations:**
- Clean reset functionality
- Intuitive button placement and color (red for clear action)
- Maintains app state appropriately

---

### 6. **Change Start** ✅ WORKING

**Functionality:**
- Allows users to select a new start point
- Appears after start point is set
- Reactivates start point selection mode

**Observations:**
- Convenient for trying different routes
- Clear button labeling

---

### 7. **Use My Location** ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING

**Functionality:**
- Button to use device GPS location as start point
- Attempts to access browser geolocation API

**Current Status:**
- Button is present and clickable
- GPS errors in console: "Location unavailable" and "Location request timed out"
- CoreLocation framework errors (macOS specific)

**Console Errors:**
```
GPS error: Location unavailable. Please check your device settings.
GPS error: Location request timed out. Retrying...
CoreLocationProvider: CoreLocation framework reported a kCLErrorLocationUnknown failure.
```

**Observations:**
- Feature implemented but not functional in test environment
- Likely due to:
  - Testing in desktop browser without GPS
  - Localhost not having HTTPS (required for geolocation in some browsers)
  - macOS location permissions not granted
- Would likely work on mobile devices with proper HTTPS deployment

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **GPS/Location Services**
- **Issue:** "Use My Location" not working in test environment
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Deploy with HTTPS for proper geolocation support
  - Add fallback message for desktop users
  - Test on mobile devices
  - Improve error messaging for users

### 2. **Accessible Routes Visualization**
- **Issue:** No visual indication of accessible vs. non-accessible paths
- **Recommendation:**
  - Color-code roads by accessibility (e.g., green for accessible)
  - Add legend explaining accessibility features
  - Show accessibility icons on route
  - Highlight accessibility features (ramps, elevators) on map

### 3. **Route Comparison**
- **Issue:** Can't compare accessible vs. standard routes
- **Recommendation:**
  - Show both routes simultaneously with different colors
  - Display distance/time differences
  - Allow toggling between route options

### 4. **Remaining Distance Updates**
- **Issue:** "Remaining" distance shown but not dynamically updated
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement live location tracking
  - Update remaining distance as user moves
  - Highlight current instruction
  - Add voice guidance option

### 5. **Building Information**
- **Issue:** Limited building details in popups
- **Recommendation:**
  - Show building photos
  - Display operating hours
  - List available rooms/departments
  - Add accessibility features info

### 6. **Offline Support**
- **Issue:** Requires internet connection
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement service worker for offline caching
  - Cache map tiles and route data
  - Add offline indicator

### 7. **Multi-Stop Routes**
- **Issue:** Only supports single start-to-end routes
- **Recommendation:**
  - Allow adding waypoints
  - Support multi-destination tours
  - Save favorite routes
